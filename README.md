🧠 SuiHashTrend – AI-Powered Trend Prediction for Sui Transactions
SuiHashTrend is a premier trend analysis platform for the Sui Network ecosystem. It leverages a Deep Dense Neural Network to predict market uptrends and downtrends for critical transaction types, including Mint, Stake, Swap, and Buy.

By combining browser-based AI, real-time on-chain data, and decentralized storage, the project delivers a transparent, reliable, and community-enhanced predictive engine.

🔥 Key Features
1. Deep Dense AI & Distributed Learning

Browser-Based Intelligence: Utilizes a Fully Connected Deep Neural Network (Deep Dense) that is trained and executed directly in the browser using TensorFlow.js.

Community-Driven Improvement: The model evolves with the community. As users interact with the platform and load historical datasets, they contribute to the collective training process. This distributed data approach ensures the model becomes smarter and more accurate over time with every user contribution.

2. Real-time On-chain Data Engine (NestJS)

A robust backend system that ingests, classifies, and normalizes transaction hash (txHash) data directly from the Sui blockchain in real-time.

3. Decentralized Model Storage (Walrus + Move Smart Contract)

Immutability: Once trained, the Deep Dense model is packaged (.zip) and stored on Walrus.

Transparency: A Move smart contract stores the specific Blob ID, ensuring the model is verifiable, easily retrievable, and tamper-proof.

4. Modern Frontend with Next.js

An intuitive interface featuring interactive dashboards, charts, historical trend analysis, and real-time AI trading signals.

🏗️ Tech Stack
Frontend: Next.js, React, TensorFlow.js (Handling Deep Dense model training & inference).

Backend: NestJS (On-chain data ingestion + preprocessing).

Blockchain: Move (Stores Blob IDs for model reference).

Storage: Walrus (Decentralized storage for model artifacts).

AI/ML: Deep Dense Neural Network (Fully Connected Multi-layer Perceptron).

🎯 Our Mission
To empower developers and investors with a decentralized, real-time, and AI-driven transaction analysis tool. SuiHashTrend aims to demystify market signals, allowing users to make data-backed decisions while participating in a collaborative ecosystem where user activity directly strengthens the AI's predictive power.
